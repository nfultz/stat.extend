Description: Highest Density Regions are the smallest set in
    the support of a probability distribution with the with a specified
    coverage probability. `HDR`s may contain disjoint intervals, but can be calculated
    efficiently using iterative methods. One can similarly construct 
    optimal (i.e., shortest) confidence intervals for some basic inferential
    problems, including for population means, variances, or proportion
    parameters.
